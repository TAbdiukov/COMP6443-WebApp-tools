# WebApp-tools
Tools designed to help pass the UNSW's COMP6443 / 6483 course (WebApp security)

Course code isn't in the repo name to prevent 'dumb' fetching the repo

## Trivia
All things here were written ASAP upon the need with the lack of optimisation

* **Misc** - Things I were working on but never got time to finish
* **bruteGetIPs** - brutes the IP addresses on the dns ns.agency website. Takes one argument, the URL
* **bruteBing** - brutes the ns.agency's pastebin knockoff on pastebing.ns.agency for the pastes encoded via Base62 scheme.  Takes two arguments, the URL and the number of (remaining) base62 places to brute
* **gent** - generates text wiithin the range and copies it to clipboard (for the future use)
* **intelBing** - a not-so successful attempt on gathering pastebing logic information by spamming pastes
* ðŸš—**peekRive** - dumps bing drive pastes via peeker-seeker
* ðŸš—**peekRive_reverse** - reverse-dumps bing drive by reverse user lookup from classic peekRive
