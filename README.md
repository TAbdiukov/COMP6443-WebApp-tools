## Trivia
All things here were written ASAP upon the need with the lack of optimisation

* **Misc** - Things I were working on but not too exciting/never got time to finish

* **bruteGetIPs** - brutes the IP addresses on the dns ns.agency website. Takes one argument, the URL
* **bruteBing** - brutes the ns.agency's pastebin knockoff on pastebing.ns.agency for the pastes encoded via Base62 scheme.  Takes two arguments, the URL and the number of (remaining) base62 places to brute
* **bruteBing++** - bruteBing with smarts
* **gent** - generates text within the range and copies it to clipboard (for the future use)
* **intelBing** - a not-so successful attempt on gathering pastebing logic information by spamming pastes
* 🚗**peekRive** - dumps bing drive pastes via peeker-seeker
* 🚗**peekRive_reverse** - reverse-dumps bing drive by reverse user lookup from classic peekRive
* 🚗🚗**riveSafe** - a tool to ashame both drives and safes
* **XSS** - everything related to XSS
* **zeroBing** - a previously private, but now successful tool for attacking pastebing via rubbish data overflow
