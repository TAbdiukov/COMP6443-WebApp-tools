# WebApp-tools
Tools designed to help pass the UNSW's COMP6443 / 6483 course (WebApp security)

Course code isn't in the repo name to prevent 'dumb' fetching the repo

## Trivia
All things here were written ASAP upon the need with the lack of optimisation

* **bruteGetIPs** - brutes the IP addresses on the dns ns.agency website. Takes one argument, the URL
* **bruteBing** - brutes the ns.agency's pastebin knockoff on pastebing.ns.agency for the pastes encoded via Base62 scheme.  Takes two arguments, the URL and the number of (remaining) base62 places to brute
* **gent** - generates text wiithin the range and copies it to clipboard (for the future use)
* **Misc** - Things I were working on but never got time to finish

## Third party useful stuff
### Scripts
* [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) - Dumps .git directories where present. Helpt me greatly a couple of times
* [dnsrecon](https://github.com/darkoperator/dnsrecon) - DNS subdomain bruteforcer
* [clone-gists.py](https://gist.github.com/SpotlightKid/042491a9a2987af04a5a) - Dump someone's all dists via API

### Apps
* [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) - Port scanning and service pentesting tool
* [sqlmap](http://sqlmap.org/) - I'll kill you all! In the sequel!
* [Burp](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload) - Intercept all traffic w/o messing with WireShark
* [WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/) - Low-level packet analytics tool
* [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) - Humanity's worst challenger

### SAAS's
* [CentralOps](https://centralops.net/co/) - Online DNS and WHOIS lookup tools
* [IpLocation](https://www.iplocation.net/) - IP location

### Docs to see
* [PayloadsAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings) - Swiss army knife for injections and what not

### Leaked data
* [9k](9k) - kill the Windows 98 
* [Flask core](https://github.com/secedu/flask-core) - core used by COMP6443

## Things I look for
* Executable arguments' blind but smart bruteforcer (both Linux and Windows)
* Cheat engine for Linux
